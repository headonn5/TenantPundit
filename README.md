# TenantPundit


Tenant Pundit is a social service app which is based on the concept of peer to peer help. Here a tenant can review the house where he lives, and also the owner of the house. This review, in turn, will help the other people who are looking for the rental properties. Tenants can browse the app to look for reviews of other houses and also contribute to the app by giving their precious review of the house where they currently live or had already lived.
